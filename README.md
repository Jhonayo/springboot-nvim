# Spring Boot NVim

Spring boot NVim is plugin currently under development to simplify the development of Java, specifically Spring Boot projects.

The plugin aims to bring features similar to that of modern Java IDE's such as Intellij and Eclipse to NeoVim.

### Features currently implemented include:

1. Incremental compiling on save, which enables Spring Boot Dev Tools to auto reload your application for rapid development.

2. Start running your Spring Boot project with a simple key mapping rather than starting up a new terminal and running the run command manually.

3. Automatic package declaration when a Java file is created in NeoVim.

4. Class, Interface, and Enum generation to reduce the need to type out boiler plate code.

We are also planning a Spring Boot Project generator based on the Spring Initializer API, as well as features from community feedback.

## Installation

Basic installation requires nvim-lspconfig and nvim-jdtls to auto compile, and gain information from the Java LSP about your project.

```lua
return {
	"elmcgill/springboot-nvim",
	depedencies = {
		"neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
		"mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls",
		"nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua",
	},
	config = function()
		local springboot_nvim = require("springboot-nvim")
		springboot_nvim.setup({})
	end,
}
```

Recommended installation and configuration

```lua
return {
    "Jhonayo/springboot-nvim",
    depedencies = {
        "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
        "mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls"
        "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
        "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    },
    config = function()
        local springboot_nvim = require("springboot-nvim")
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>Jr", springboot_nvim.boot_run, { desc = "Spring Boot Run Project" })
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>Js", springboot_nvim.stop_server, { desc = "Spring Boot Stop Project" })
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>Jc", springboot_nvim.generate_class, { desc = "Java Create Class" })
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>Ji", springboot_nvim.generate_interface, { desc = "Java Create Interface" })
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>Je", springboot_nvim.generate_enum, { desc = "Java Create Enum" })
        vim.keymap.set('n', "<leader>Jn", "<cmd>SpringBootNewProject<cr>", {desc = "New Spring Project"})
        springboot_nvim.setup({})
    end
}
```

## Creating a New Spring Boot Project

To create a new Spring Boot project in Neovim, you can use the SpringBootNewProject command. This command leverages the functionality of the Neovim plugin to automatically generate a Spring Boot project by fetching it from https://start.spring.io.

Here's what the SpringBootNewProject command does:

    Fetch Project Metadata: The command sends a request to start.spring.io to retrieve the latest metadata for project configuration.
    Generate Project: Based on the metadata and user-specified options, it generates a new Spring Boot project.
    Download Project: The generated project is then downloaded and saved to your local system, ready for you to start coding.

To use this feature, simply run the following command in Neovim:

```vim
:SpringBootNewProject
```

This will initiate the process of creating a new Spring Boot project tailored to your specifications.
